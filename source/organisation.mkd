### Meetings

The core team meets over Google hangouts on a biweekly basis to discuss
bioboxes. This meeting is split into the 30 minutes where we discuss open
issues on the tracker and try to resolve them. This part of the meeting is for
core team where we review the current outstanding issues, open to anyone may
attend who would like to be assigned issues. The later 30 minutes of the
meeting is a more general discussion where we invited someone in a field
related to the project to tell us what they are working on.
